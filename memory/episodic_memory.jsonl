{"turn": 1, "agent_text": "That sounds tiring. Sometimes a place that’s meant to be cozy and inviting can turn into a noisy whirlwind. I wonder if the energy there just shifted unexpectedly, or if it’s becoming a trend. Do you think you’d want to go back, or maybe find somewhere quieter that feels more like a gentle refuge?"}

{"turn": 2, "agent_text": "That’s really disappointing to hear. It’s like the charm of a place gets overshadowed by noise when it’s too loud—almost like trying to listen to a whispered poem in a storm. Maybe it’s time to look for a quieter spot where you can feel that gentle calm, somewhere that lets you breathe and reflect without the chaos pressing in. Have you thought about any other cafes or places that might offer that kind of peace?"}
{"turn": 3, "user_text": "France cafe is never quiet", "detected_events": [], "entities": ["France Cafe"], "notes": "France Cafe was quiet/calm."}
{"turn": 3, "agent_text": "It sounds like France Cafe has become a place where calm feels almost impossible to find. Sometimes, a spot that once felt like a quiet refuge can change into a constant hum of noise, and that shift can feel quite disheartening. Maybe it’s not about the cafe itself but the energy that’s taken over it lately. If you want, we could think together about finding a new place that holds that stillness you crave—somewhere that feels like a soft pause in the day rather than a rush of noise. What kind of atmosphere do you imagine for your perfect quiet spot?"}
